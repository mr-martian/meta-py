# meta-py
Common Lisp code gen for Python

Very experimental. To try, do something like:

```bash
$ sbcl --script meta-py.lisp
```

This will compile `test.lisp` and print the contents, assuming [SBCL](https://www.sbcl.org/) (it should work with other implementations, but I haven't tested).

Inspired by [c-mera](https://github.com/kiselgra/c-mera).
